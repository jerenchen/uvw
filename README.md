## Universal Variables Workspace

Universal Variables Workspace (UVW) is a simple C++ framework for managing global named variables as well as the "processors" that process them.

### Requirements

There is no external dependency, although it does require C++14 since UVW utilizes "variable templates".

### TODOs

- Inter-processor variables linkage/dependency.
- Serialization/de-serialization.
- ...
